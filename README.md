Modelling objectives: 

1) To predict the price of resale flats using Artificial Neural Network regression.

2) To understand what are factors that drive or determine housing prices.

Explained variance score was used to assess ANN regression prediction model, it yield = 0.64

Explained variance score is similar to R^2 score, regression score function. Best possible score = 1.0
